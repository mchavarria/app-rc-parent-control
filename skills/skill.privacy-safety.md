# skill.privacy-safety.md — Consent, privacy, and safety

## Principles
- Explicit consent every session
- Clear UI indicators while sharing
- One-tap stop
- Minimal data retention

## Must-haves for v1
- Pre-share explainer screen: what is shared, who can see it, how to stop
- Visible “LIVE” badge + persistent notification (Android)
- Session link/join code expires quickly (e.g., 10–30 minutes)
- Viewer authentication (at least magic link or one-time code)

## Nice-to-haves
- Allowlist trusted helpers
- “Pause sharing” button
- Optional voice-only mode

## Do not do
- Background/hidden capture
- Recording without an explicit opt-in
